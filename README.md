## nullrish

### know about me
hey there! i'm **nullrish** (or in simple term **rish**) welcome to my github page where you'd find loads of random stuff that i made cause i love learning
something each and every day of my life (as long as it's related to computers ðŸ’»).

### what am i even doing?
for now i'm learning about data structures and algorithm which i have found really fun to practice. i also enjoy making 
projects no matter what it is, experimenting with different tech stacks and finally i can't imagine my daily coding session
without linux. *i use arch btw.*

### languages that i am familiar with
- go
- typescript
- rust
- python
- c++
ofc there'll be other languages too that i am familiar with but these 5 languages are what i usually build my stuff at.

### software that i use to make things
- operating system: arch linux (w hyprland)
- editor: neovim (w lazyvim)

well, enjoy and have a great day...

## nullrish

### know about me
hey there! i'm **nullrish** (or in simple term **rish**) welcome to my github page where you'd find loads of random stuff that i made cause i love learning
something each and every day of my life (as long as it's related to computers 💻).

### what am i even doing?
for now i'm learning about data structures and algorithm which i have found really fun to practice. i also enjoy making 
projects no matter what it is, experimenting with different tech stacks and finally i can't imagine my daily coding session
without linux. *i use arch btw.*

### techstack
I've used lot of tech to build something from coding to graphcis designing i've used quite a bit and you can see them below.

however, my primary languages are (the onces that i enjoy writing in and if i've to build something it'll be in one of these language):
